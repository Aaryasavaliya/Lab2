This code generates a bar chart displaying the distribution of target labels in a dataset. It calculates the count of each class (e.g., Healthy and Diseased) and plots them on the y-axis against custom labels on the x-axis (e.g., Health Status). The visualization provides a clear overview of the dataset's class distribution, aiding in understanding the data's balance or imbalance.
